# React + Vite

## This is a school assignment for friday the 24-11-2023

The content is an app that works as a shopping list, with all the knowledge about Javascript, React an jsx that we have learned so far.

It is running a JSON server which can be started with the command: npm run jsonserver, or from the package.json.

the app itself can be run from the command: npm run dev, or again from the package.json file.

There is full CRUD coverage and every function works.

The styling is not the prettiest but there is some bootstrap and some inline jsx html based styling too.

I futhermore thought about implementing a sum of costs for eksample but i did't get to do that and my girlfriend is comming soon.

I actully had the summarization working to some degree earlier yesterday thursday, but i went away from it again.

This is friday 15:59 and I'm handing in.

P.S. In the repository root folder is the video with a short presentation.

Enjoi!!!!
